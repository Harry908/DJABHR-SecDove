# WebSocket to Polling Migration for Vercel Compatibility

## Problem
Vercel serverless functions do not support persistent WebSocket connections. This causes Socket.IO to fail with 400 Bad Request errors when attempting to establish WebSocket connections.

## Root Cause
- Vercel's serverless architecture terminates function execution after request completion
- WebSockets require persistent connections that outlive individual function calls
- Socket.IO defaults to WebSocket transport, which fails on Vercel

## Solution
Modified both client and server to use HTTP polling instead of WebSockets, maintaining real-time functionality while being compatible with Vercel's serverless environment.

## Changes Made

### Client Configuration (`client/src/context/WebSocketContext.jsx`)
```javascript
const socket = io(SOCKET_URL, {
  path: SOCKET_PATH,
  autoConnect: true,
  reconnection: true,
  reconnectionDelay: 1000,
  reconnectionAttempts: 5,
  transports: ['polling'], // Force polling transport
  upgrade: false, // Disable WebSocket upgrade attempts
  rememberUpgrade: false, // Don't remember upgrade capability
  timeout: 20000 // Increase timeout for polling
});
```

### Server Configuration (`server/server.js`)
```javascript
const io = new Server(httpServer, {
  cors: { /* existing cors config */ },
  transports: ['polling'], // Force polling transport
  allowUpgrades: false // Disable WebSocket upgrade attempts
});
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Works on Vercel free tier
- ✅ Maintains real-time messaging features
- ✅ No code changes required for core functionality
- ✅ Backward compatible with WebSocket-capable platforms

## Performance Considerations
- Polling uses more bandwidth than WebSockets
- Slightly higher latency for real-time updates
- Acceptable trade-off for Vercel compatibility

## Future Options
If real-time performance becomes critical, consider:
1. Upgrading to Vercel Pro (supports WebSockets)
2. Migrating to WebSocket-compatible hosting (Railway, Render, etc.)
3. Implementing Server-Sent Events (SSE) as alternative

## Testing
Server starts successfully with polling configuration. Deploy to Vercel to test end-to-end functionality.
